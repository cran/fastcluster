Description: This is a two-in-one package which provides interfaces to
        both R and 'Python'. It implements fast hierarchical, agglomerative
        clustering routines. Part of the functionality is designed as drop-in
        replacement for existing routines: linkage() in the 'SciPy' package
        'scipy.cluster.hierarchy', hclust() in R's 'stats' package, and the
        'flashClust' package. It provides the same functionality with the
        benefit of a much faster implementation. Moreover, there are
        memory-saving routines for clustering of vector data, which go beyond
        what the existing packages provide. For information on how to install
        the 'Python' files, see the file INSTALL in the source distribution.
        Based on the present package, Christoph Dalitz also wrote a pure 'C++'
        interface to 'fastcluster':
